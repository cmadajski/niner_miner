# Niner Miner - E-commerce for UNCC Students

This web application is a project created for ITSC 4155 Software Engineering Capstone.
The goal is to create an e-commerce platform similar to OfferUp and Craigslist that allows for UNCC
students to buy and sell personal goods. The unique feature we seek to offer is using
UNCC email verification to ensure that only legitimate UNCC students are involed in
buying and selling. This helps overcome the issue of anonymity that causes so many
problems on already existing services. Our service will provide an additional layer of
security and trust to students and incentivize them to use our platform instead of the
competitors.
