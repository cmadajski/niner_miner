                <h2>E-Commerce for the UNCC Community</h2>
                <p>
                    Niner Miner is a web application similar to services like Facebook
                    Marketplace or OfferUp where people can buy or sell items to one another
                    in an open marketplace. <br><br>What separates Niner Miner is that all accounts
                    are linked to a UNCC email address, which decreases bad behavior and sketchy
                    deals. <br><br>Anyone who violates the Terms of Service can and will be banned based
                    on the severity of their infraction and that email will be blacklisted from 
                    the Niner Miner service indefinitely.<br><br> Likewise, items can only be sold
                    on campus, so there's no need to worry about shipping. You can select one of many
                    locations on campus to meet with a buyer or seller before committing to a purchase.

                <h2>Requirements</h2>
                <p>
                    In order to use the Niner Miner application, you
                    will need:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>an active UNCC email address</li>
                    <li>your UNCC ID number</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    After sign up, a verification code will be sent to the given email
                    to help verify that you are actually a UNCC student and not some
                    imposter!
                </p>

                    NOTE FROM 06/29/2022): SIGN UP, VERIFICATION, AND PASSWORD RESET HAVE
                    ALL BEEN DISABLED TEMPORARILY BECAUSE GOOGLE UPDATED THEIR SMTP
                    SECURITY AND BROKE MY EMAIL SYSTEM. <br>THANKS GOOGLE -__-
