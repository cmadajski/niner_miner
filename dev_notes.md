# Developer Notes for Niner Miner Web Application
This document provides a brief overview of the technical aspects of
the Niner Miner Webapp.
## Basic File Structure
The application currently uses a very simplified file structure. All code
for the application can be found in the "src" directory. Routes, app logic, and flask application creation are all found in the "main.py" file.
The templates directory holds all the html files. The static directory
holds all the styling information, including:
- CSS
- images
- fonts
- videos
